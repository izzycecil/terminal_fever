Data for our preliminary results were collected using Google Forms. The
prototype would issue information to the user to take an entry survey, guide
them through the features, and finish with an exit survey. The two surveys
contained the following questions:

In between these surveys we presented a demo of our system.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Data analysis was carried out using the Julia and Python languages, along with
various statistical tools. A cursory data analysis was also provided by Google
Sheets, allowing an overview of the results from each question.

The first thing we want to do is understand the demographics of our
survey. Primarily, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the primary responding group was
male CS majors. Linux was the dominant operating system, but not exclusive. The
reported education levels were diverse, spanning from the sophomore to graduate
levels.

We used the following Julia code to analyze the relative skill levels of our
users. Simply summing up the comfort level of all questions on the Entry survey,
we ranked users from Novice (0 experience) to Expert (39). Figure
\ref{fig:skill} shows a histogram representing user skill. You will notice that
the majority of our users are more experienced (self-reportedly). This does not
align with our target audience, however there was novice representation.

To analyze different groups of users and their attitudes toward our prototype,
we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for every pair of survey
questions. To our surprise, there were no strong correlations between the
responses on the exit survey and \emph{any} of the demographic
statistics\footnote{The most significant demographic education level, which
  still had a $p$-value over $0.10$!}.  However, the data analysis did show many
interesting correlations between the questions themselves.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/stats/sig.png}
  \label{fig:p_table}
  \caption{A matrix highlighting the Pearson correlations between each pair of
    survey questions for which the $p$-value was $< 0.05$. Darker squares
    indicate stronger correlations in the users' answers. The bold line on the
    diagonal indicates that each question was 100\% correlated with itself.}
\end{figure}

To get a better understanding of how our users were grouped we conducted several
standard pearson product-moment correlation coefficient analysis'. Firstly, we
compared how users were most significantly grouped by how they answered the
entry and exit surveys. Figure \ref{fig:p_plot} shows these results in a
graphical form, with the table available in Appendix \ref{fig:p_table}. Marked
in color are the correlation values in all instances where the p-value is
significant (less than 0.05). A divergent colormap is used: red indicating
negative correlation, the darker the stronger; blue indicating positive
correlation, the darker the stronger. Everything less than significant has been
omitted for clarity.

Our entry survey had three groups of questions intended to serve as 'vectors'
for a user: usability, efficiency, and knowledge. This usability vector is
composed of the questions in the top-left corner of the pearson graph. We can
see that this vector is not homogenous -  a user's given response on one of the
vector's questions does not correlate to most of the rest of the vector's
questions. The next set, efficency, is better connected; "I use control
structures in the shell" is the outlier for this group. The last set on the
entry survey, knowledge, is fairly homogenous. "I use a wide array of commands"
is correlated with all other questions in this vector; the rest are correlated
with half or more of the vector.

Our exit survey was composed of three vectors of questions as well: usability,
education, and intention. Each of these vectors is fairly homogenous. The
usability group has a single outlier: "I find the interface of the system
inviting and usable". Interestingly, this question is well-correlated with the
education vector. Both the education and intention vectors are fully correlated.

The Pearson correlation matrix shows a few correlations of significance outside
of the question vectors.  From the entry survey the question most correlated to
others is "I feel comfortable using the shell". Users' responses to this question
have a positive correlation with two question under the efficiency vector, three
question under the knowledge vector, a single question under the usability
vector, and two questions under the education vector. This shows that users who
are more comfortable with using the shell are also more likely to self-report
being skilled users of it, unsurprisingly. From the exit survey questions, this
collection shows that users who self-reported being more comfortable with the
shell also found the prototype more usable. This might indicate that our
prototype is failing to serve our target of entry-level users.

From the exit survey the most widely associable response is a user's answer to
the question "The system would improve my usage of the shell." The responses to
this question are positively correlateable to every other question on the exit
survey.

The only negative correlation of significance is between two question on the
entry survey: "I use control structures in the shell" and "I think I would
prefer the shell if I understood it".

!!! FIGURE HERE !!!

In \ref{fig:all} can be seen an overview of all of our responses. There were no
correlations of significance between education levels and any response, so we
choose to analyze the data as a single group. On the entry survey most users
reported low comfort with shell usage and a preference for GUI tools. Almost all
users use piping and redirection in the shell; control structure use is less
common; most users do not use wildcards. Within the knowledge vector most users
reported difficulties with knowing and finding the information on how to
complete tasks. Most users did not feel that they used a wide array of commands.

From the exit survey we can see that most users disagreed with our prototype
being usable, educational, or a good experience.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
    8d. Describe the quantitative/qualitative analysis results with proper
    statistics test/grounded theory. You should also indicate whether or not the
    analysis result can support the hypotheses in Section 8.

Our entry and exit surveys each had at least one qualitative response question.
The responses to these can be seen in Appendix \ref{fig:fig_data}.
The entry survey asked users what tasks they commonly carried out in the shell.
Seven out of the fifteen responses indicated navigation and file manipulation,
five indicated programming-related tasks, and four indicated searching.

There were two qualitative response questions on the exit survey. The first
asked users what they liked most about the prototype. There is no clear
consensus here - users reported liking the GUI elements, the context window, the
undo functionality, the suggested automations, and other disparate features.

The second asked users what they thought needed the most improvement in the
prototype. Three users indicated that more information is needed in the
interface; one wrote: "More instructions on what the buttons on bottom will do
if pressed would be nice-- I know the functionality of the buttons isn't
implemented yet, but a small message explaining what the buttons represent and
happens when they are clicked would go a long way". Two users reported confusion
with the prototype. Five did not provide an answer or indicated that they had no
suggestions.
