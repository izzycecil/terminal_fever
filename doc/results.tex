Data for our preliminary results were collected using Google Forms. The
prototype would issue information to the user to take an entry survey, guide
them through the features, and finish with an exit survey. The two surveys
contained the following questions:

In between these surveys we presented a demo of our system.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Data analysis was carried out using the Julia and Python languages, along with
various statistical tools. A cursory data analysis was also provided by Google
Sheets, allowing an overview of the results from each question.

The first thing we want to do is understand the demographics of our
survey. Primarily, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the primary responding group was
male CS majors. Linux was the dominant operating system, but not exclusive. The
reported education levels were diverse, spanning from the sophomore to graduate
levels.

% TODO: Probably make subfigs for this data?

\end{figure}

We used the following Julia code to analyze the relative skill levels of our
users. Simply summing up the comfort level of all questions on the Entry survey,
we ranked users from Novice (0 experience) to Expert (39). Figure
\ref{fig:skill} shows a histogram representing user skill. You will notice that
the majority of our users are more experienced (self-reportedly). This does not
align with our target audience, however there was novice representation.

  \caption{\label{fig:Skill} Histogram showing the relative skill levels of the
    user base. Note the larger right tail. }
\end{figure}

To get a better understanding of how our users were grouped we conducted several
standard pearson product-moment correlation coefficient analysis'. Firstly, we
compared how users were most significantly grouped by how they answered the
entry and exit surveys. Figure \ref{fig:p_plot} shows these results in a
graphical form, with the table available in Appendix \ref{fig:p_table}. Marked
in color are the correlation values in all instances where the p-value is
significant (less than 0.05). A divergent colormap is used: red indicating
negative correlation, the darker the stronger; blue indicating positive
correlation, the darker the stronger. Everything less than significant has been
omitted for clarity.

From the entry survey the most widely associable response is a user's answer to
the question "I feel comfortable using the shell". This responses to this
question have a positive correlation to two responses under the efficiency
vector, three responses under the knowledge vector, a single question under the
usability vector, and two questions under the education vector. This shows that
users who are more comfortable with using the shell are also more likely to be
skilled users of it, unsurprisingly. From the exit survey questions, this graph
shows that users who self-reported being more comfortable with the shell also
found the prototype more usable.

From the exit survey the most widely associable response is a user's answer to
the question "The system would improve my usage of the shell." The responses to
this question are positively correlateable to every other question on the exit
survey.

The only significant negative correlation is between two question on the entry
survey: "I use control structures in the shell" and "I think I would prefer the
shell if I understood it".

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
    8d. Describe the quantitative/qualitative analysis results with proper
    statistics test/grounded theory. You should also indicate whether or not the
    analysis result can support the hypotheses in Section 8.

Our entry and exit surveys each had at least one qualitative response question.
The responses to these can be seen in Appendix \ref{fig:fig_data}.
The entry survey asked users what tasks they commonly carried out in the shell.
Seven out of the fifteen responses indicated navigation and file manipulation,
five indicated programming-related tasks, and four indicated searching.

There were two qualitative response questions on the exit survey. The first
asked users what they liked most about the prototype. There is no clear
consensus here - users reported liking the GUI elements, the context window, the
undo functionality, the suggested automations, and other disparate features.

The second asked users what they thought needed the most improvement in the
prototype. Three users indicated that more information is needed in the
interface; one wrote: "More instructions on what the buttons on bottom will do
if pressed would be nice-- I know the functionality of the buttons isn't
implemented yet, but a small message explaining what the buttons represent and
happens when they are clicked would go a long way". Two users reported confusion
with the prototype. Five did not provide an answer or indicated that they had no
suggestions.
