Throughout this report, we have demonstrated a collection of enhancements that
could be made to the typical Unix command line shell in order to increase
efficiency, usability, and understand-ability of the system. Targeting those
learning Unix for the first time, we hoped to demonstrate ways to help teach
beginners, by bringing common GUI techniques to the command line. Once we have
left the prototype phase, a more extensive analysis can be carried out, as
described in Section \ref{sec:eval}.

Thus far we have designed a basic prototype of the system, highlighting the
GUI techniques and core functionality of our system. 

9a. Briefly describe what the system is and how you evaluate the system
9b. Use a list to describe which hypotheses in Section 7 are supported in the evaluation
9c. (optional) List the findings which are in the hyphteses.
9d. (optional) List possible strategies to enhanced the system
