In this report we have proposed a collection of enhancements that
could be made to the typical Unix command line shell. We've suggested these
changes in order to tackle the shell's most glaring issues: the steep learning
curve, the dearth of contextual information, and the ease with which one can
irrecoverably lose information. Targeting those learning Unix for the first
time, we hoped to demonstrate how bringing common GUI techniques to the command
line can drastically improve the user experience. Once we have left the
prototype phase a more extensive analysis can be carried out, as described in
Section \ref{sec:eval}.

Thus far we have designed a basic web-based prototype of the system, one that
highlights it's novel GUI techniques and core functionality. As is discussed
above, we've gone through a preliminary user study of our prototype. This study
consisted of an entry survey to gauge users' prior experience with the shell,
and attitudes towards the shell. Following a walkthrough of the prototype, we
queried users on their experience: whether they found it usable, educational,
and enjoyable. These results can now be used to evaluate and refine the
prototype in response to users' critiques.

In Section \ref{sec:results} we analyzed the user responses to both surveys. This
section of testing was intended to test the hypothesis that users who use our
program would report a more positive user experience. On the entry survey
querying a user's self-reported experience with the shell with regards to
usability, efficiency, and knowledge users reported an average rating of 1.9,
2.2, and 2.0 respectively (from 1 to 4 in a Likert-style questionnaire). On the
exit survey users ranked the prototype a 1.9, 1.7, and 1.9 on its usability,
educational potential, and their experience with it respectively (from 1 to 4 in
a Likert-style questionnaire).

Based upon these ratings, we conclude that our hypothesis here is not supported
by the reactions to this prototype. The command line interface certainly can be
made more user friendly by the application of user interface design techniques,
and more work and research on our prototype can help us accomplish that goal in
the future.
