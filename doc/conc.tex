In this report we have proposed a collection of enhancements that
could be made to the typical Unix command line shell. We've suggested these
changes in order to tackle the shell's most glaring issues: the steep learning
curve, the dearth of contextual information, and the ease with which one can
irrecoverably lose information. Targeting those learning Unix for the first
time, we hoped to demonstrate that bringing common GUI elements to the command
line could drastically improve the user experience. Once we've left the
prototype phase a more extensive analysis can be carried out, as described in
Section \ref{sec:eval}.

Thus far we have designed a basic web-based prototype of the system, one that
highlights it's novel GUI techniques and core functionality. As is discussed
above, we've gone through a preliminary user study of our prototype. This study
consisted of an entry survey to gauge users' prior experience with the shell,
and attitudes towards the shell. Following a walkthrough of the prototype we
queried users on their experience: whether they found it usable, educational,
and enjoyable.

As detailed in Section \ref{sec:eval}, we have hypothesized the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users who use our program will have a higher unique command count than
  the control group.
  \item Users who use our program will report a more positive user experience.
  \item Users who use our program will maintain their unique command count
  outside of our shell.
\end{itemize}
Our survey process was designed to test the second of these - that users who
user our program will report a more positive user experience. Our other two
hypothesis can be tested once a fuller prototype has been built. Based upon our
analysis of the user responses to the prototype, we conclude that this
hypothesis is not supported for the current revision of our prototype. These
results can now be used to evaluate and refine the prototype in response to
users' critiques.

We still believe that the command line interface can be made more user friendly
with the application of user interface design techniques - just not, perhaps,
with our current proposal above. More work and research on this prototype can
help us accomplish that goal in the future, in a real and test-driven way.
