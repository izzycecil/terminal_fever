In Figure \ref{fig:undo} we can see an example interface for the preview window
for our terminal. After a command is entered, this shows the user what changes
to their system will result if they choose to admit the command. This interface
creates an escape hatch which allows the user to return the entire shell to the
state before the previous command. The layout is designed with the idea of
responsive disclosure in mind. The pane, which displays a list of information
about the staged changes, will be shown only when that info is relevant to the
user.
