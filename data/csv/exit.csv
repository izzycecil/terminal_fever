"Name","This system would improve my usage of the shell.","This system would help me solve problems in the shell.","This system is more usable than a traditional shell.","I find the interface of the system inviting and usable.","This system would teach me commands in a more effective way that  the status quo.","This system would help me perform automations that I would not make on my own.","Using this system would improve my understanding of all shells.","I would prefer this to the normal shell experience","I would use this system in the future.","I would suggest this system to others.","What did you like most about the system?","What do you think needs the most improvements?"
"1","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","3","2","1","The demo was very instructive, so the system would be a good introduction for people who are brand new to using the shell.","More instructions on what the buttons on bottom will do if pressed would be nice-- I know the functionality of the buttons isn't implemented yet, but a small message explaining what the buttons represent and happens when they are clicked would go a long way"
"4","1","3","2","1","2","2","1","1","2","1","It's very friendly and helpful. It is a good introduction to the shell.","Although, new users might appreciate pointers on where to go to learn more after this short introduction. Also, maybe have arrows to skip commands or man pages for the curious readers."

"22","1","2","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","The ability to easily create automated tasks","The presentation of the options could use more work. At the moment it looks like it presents as if it were any other shell in the sense that it just lists the files. It would be easier if there were some categorization , especially considering commands that have an extremely long list of options or subcommands. This is probably pedantic, but it also wasn't clear that there was a git repository when removing index."
"5","2","3","1","1","1","3","2","1","1","1","Combining the shell + a graphical view is very cool; suggestions are good, but suggested automation is really neat!","I'm nervous about the discoverability of the ""help"" command. I would have typed ""help ls"" for instanceâ€”but there's already info and man and --help, so I'm not sure I would remember to use it. (Have you seen https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck?)"

"17","2","1","2","1","1","2","1","2","1","1","The descriptions were very informative and comprehensive. A very interesting way to consolidate what I am doing/ what I want to do.","I don't have any constructive comments."
"3","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","3","It seems intuitive and easy to use/understand. ","Hm. Can't think of anything right now, but I'm going to go play with it some more and see what I find! "

"22","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","I really like the idea of being able to see what my options are visually. The undo function is very cool if you accidentally do something that you normally couldn't take back, such as deleting a file. 

I feel the shell could be used for not only new users to Linux but to older users as well. ","I think the comments the shell writes back should be brighter."

"25","3","3","2","2","1","3","2","2","3","1","Makes shell easier to learn; more accessible than trying to decipher long man pages.","I wouldn't want to be the person who has to implement all the context-awareness element of it, unless you're planning on building some kind of AI for that."
"27","1","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","2","It was a good teaching tool. I like that you have to type, which makes you actually read it.","I am not sure. It seems good to me."
